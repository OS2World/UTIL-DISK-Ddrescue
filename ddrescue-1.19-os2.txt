       Short Description: Ddrescue - Data recovery tool
        Long Description: GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool. It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc) to another, trying hard to rescue data in case of read errors.Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue logfiles, shows logfile contents, converts logfiles to/from other formats, compares logfiles, tests rescue status, and can delete a logfile if the rescue is done. Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one or several parts of the logfile if the domain setting options are used.
